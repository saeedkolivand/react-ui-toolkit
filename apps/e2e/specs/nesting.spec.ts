/**
 * Which of our own CSS rules reach a component when it is nested.
 *
 * `data-part` is a shared namespace — thirty-three names are used by more than
 * one component, `label` by twelve and `item` by ten — so a loose descendant
 * rule on anything that holds arbitrary content reaches whatever a consumer
 * puts inside it.
 *
 * Matching *selectors* rather than computed style, because computed style
 * cannot tell a leak from ordinary inheritance: an Alert setting 14px for
 * everything it holds is correct, and a rule reaching in to set the same 14px
 * on one part is not. Comparing the two lists says exactly which rules matched
 * an element in one position and not the other.
